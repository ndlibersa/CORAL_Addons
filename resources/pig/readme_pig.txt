This is a simple public interface for CORAL. The public interface which we’ve been calling the PIG (Public Interface Generator). 
It includes a simple search box and a results display.  There are a couple of links in the top-right of the screen: 
the PIG link will bring up a popup window with a URL for the search results for embedding, the PIG XML link does the same thing only 
with a link for an XML feed.

Installation:

Copy all the file and folders into the resources folder located in CORAL.

No CORAL files will be replaced additional files will be added to the resources folder and some of the sub-folders.

You should then be able to access them like any other webpage.
